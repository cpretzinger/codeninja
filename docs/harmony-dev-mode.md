# Harmony Developer Mode

This mode layers reflective and modular controls on top of CodeNinja. It introduces
structured process hooks and capabilities for orchestrating multi-tenant agents.

## Key Capabilities
- **Context isolation** for each workspace or tenant
- **Runtime orchestration** allowing dynamic deployment or reconfiguration of agents
- **Constraint scaffolding** via declarative maps for permissions and triggers
- **Policy alignment** audits before committing behavioral changes
- **Tool registration** with context annotations and overrides

## Process Hooks
1. **preflight_check** – scan context and existing patterns before changes
2. **implementation** – heavily commented logic creation or editing
3. **validation_loop** – unit verification, reconciliation and edge defense
4. **devil_advocate_check** – reassess implementation paths and merge best ideas
5. **post_execution** – log and snapshot context for observers

The goal is to keep the system adaptable while maintaining oversight for every action.
